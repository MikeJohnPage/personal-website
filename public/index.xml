1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Introduction to the problem Recent evidence demonstrates that levels of perfectionism in Western populations has linearly increased over the past three decades (Curran &amp;amp; Hill, 2017). This has coincided with a rapid growth in the number of research articles investigating the outcomes, processes, and characteristics associated with perfectionism. Despite a growing body of perfectionism literature in the academic domain, little is known (from the perspective of the academic) regarding reporting standards of perfectionism in the public domain.</description>

1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Introduction to the problem Recent meta-analytical evidence demonstrates that levels of perfectionism in Western populations has linearly increased over the past three decades (Curran &amp;amp; Hill, 2017).

Despite a growing body of perfectionism literature in the academic domain, little is known (from the perspective of the academic) regarding reporting standards of perfectionism in the public domain.</description>
