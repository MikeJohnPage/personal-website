INFO This post isn’t so much a ‘blog’ post as it is a repository for me to store my code for the ‘Phyllotaxis: Draw flowers using mathematics’ project which can be found on DataCamp. Most of the code follows the standard solutions for the project, with the exception of using theme_void() to remove elements from a plot. Using theme_void() is a more elegant solution, in this case, than independetly assigning element_blank() to each element (e.</description>

INTRODUCTION Nested data structures When selecting an analysis for a given data set it is important to consider if the data is in a nested (i.e., hierarchical/clustered/grouped) structure. A nested data structure is one in which the data is organised at more than one level. For example, students can be nested within classes as so:
 In a similar fashion, it could be said that individual student test scores can be nested within students, who are nested within classes, which are nested within schools:</description>

1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Introduction to the problem Recent meta-analytical evidence demonstrates that levels of perfectionism in Western populations has linearly increased over the past three decades (Curran &amp;amp; Hill, 2017). This has coincided with a rapid growth in the number of research articles investigating the outcomes, processes, and characteristics associated with perfectionism since the introduction of the first multidimensional perfectionism measures in the early 90’s. Despite a growing body of perfectionism literature in the academic domain, little is known (from the perspective of the academic) regarding reporting standards of perfectionism in the public domain.</description>
