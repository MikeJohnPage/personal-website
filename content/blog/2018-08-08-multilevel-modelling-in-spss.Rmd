##### What is a multilevel model?

One important question to ask when selecting an analysis for a given data set is: is the data in a nested (i.e., hierarchial/clustered/grouped) stucture? A nested data structure is one in which the data is organised at more than one level. For example, students are nested within class as so:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("/img/blog/SPSS/img1.jpeg")

```



The level of nesting can extend beyond two levels. For example individual student scores can be nested within students, who are then nested within classes, which are nested within regions, etc:




Why is this important? Simple linear regression the effect of hospital gets treated the same across all participants



Generally multilevel models are useful for exploring how relationships vary across higher-level units, for example schools.

In reality a lot of data is nested, and a typical regression analysis will introduce large amounts of error in to the model.

##### Why use multilevel models over regression?

When dealing with a nested data structure, multilevel models offer several distinct advantages over OLS regression:

1. Multilevel models do not require independence of observations (i.e., the same participant can be measured twice without confounding the data).
2. Multilevel models do not require homegeneity of regression slopes (i.e., multilevel models explicitly model variability in regression slopes; Field, 2009).
3. Multilevel models play nicely with missing (i.e., NA) data.
