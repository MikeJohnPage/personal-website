<h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<hr />
<div id="introduction-to-the-problem" class="section level5">
<h5>1.1 Introduction to the problem</h5>
<p>Recent meta-analytical evidence demonstrates that levels of perfectionism in Western populations has linearly increased over the past three decades (Curran &amp; Hill, 2017). This has coincided with a rapid growth in the number of research articles investigating the outcomes, processes, and characteristics associated with perfectionism since the introduction of the first multidimensional perfectionism measures in the early 90’s. Despite a growing body of perfectionism literature in the academic domain, little is known (from the perspective of the academic) regarding reporting standards of perfectionism in the public domain. Indeed, it is important that academic research is <em>accurately</em> translated and disseminated to the broader public. Nonetheless, the extent to which this holds true in the realm of perfectionism is unknown.</p>
</div>
<div id="perfectionism" class="section level5">
<h5>1.2 Perfectionism</h5>
<p>Broadly defined, perfectionism is understood to be a multidimensional personality trait consisting of two higher-order dimensions: perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns (Stoeber &amp; Otto, 2006). Perfectionistic strivings capture the setting of high performance standards and self- oriented strivings for perfection, whereas perfectionistic concerns capture the negative reactions to imperfections and mistakes, and the fear of negative social appraisal (Gotwals, Stoeber, Dunn, and Stoll, 2012). These two dimensions are considered to be part of a hierarchical model or heuristic representative of a range of different models that exists (Hill, 2016). Multiple reviews support that both perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns display a typical pattern of findings: perfectionistic strivings are associated with adaptive outcomes, processes and characteristics, whereas perfectionistic concerns are associated with maladaptive outcomes, processes, and characteristics (e.g., Gotwals et al., 2012, Stoeber, 2011, Stoeber &amp; Otto, 2006). One may therefore expect public reporting of perfectionism to reflect this patterns of findings.</p>
</div>
<div id="framing-the-problem" class="section level5">
<h5>1.3 Framing the problem</h5>
<p>An assessment of the meaning and social understanding of perfectionism, both in regards to whether it is perceived as a positive and/or negative trait (in line with the research on perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns), and inferred by the other words/topics it coalesces with, would contribute to research in this area. Fortunately, a wealth of natural language processing tools are at the researchers disposal to answer such questions. These include sentiment analyses and machine learning methods such as topic modelling. The purpose of this project is, therefore, to employ a variety of natural language processing techniques to better understand how perfectionism is reported in the public domain.</p>

<h3>2. DATA WRANGLING</h3>
<hr />
<div id="newsriver-api-client" class="section level5">
<h5>2.1 NewsRiver API client</h5>
<p>To obtain data, an API client for the <a href="https://newsriver.io">NewsRiver API</a> was built using the ‘httr’ package. Code for the API client (alongside code for the whole project) can be found in the appendix (it should be noted that where relevant, code is also included in text). The NewsRiver API was selected for its large library of news sources and broad range of programmable search parameters. Accordingly, the API client was designed to accept a variety of search parameters from search dates to title and text keyword searches (among others):</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Set date range for api search

search_dates &lt;- seq(as.Date(&quot;2017-07-01&quot;), as.Date(&quot;2018-07-01&quot;), by = &quot;months&quot;)

# Set query parameters to be called

query &lt;- sprintf(&#39;title:(&quot;perfectionism&quot; OR &quot;perfect&quot;) AND text:&quot;perfectionism&quot; AND language:en AND discoverDate:[%s TO %s]&#39;, search_dates, search_dates %m+% months(1))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="wrangling-json-files" class="section level5">
<h5>2.2 Wrangling JSON files</h5>
<p>The API returned a JSON file which was then parsed as text and stored in a data frame object (in this instance as a tibble). The returned tibble contained 19 different variables, many of which contained metadata and non-essential information (e.g., read time, website icon url, etc.). Moreover, many of these non-essential variables contained large quantities of NA values. Subsequently, four key variables of interest (title, text, date, and website) were selected inline with the aims of the project. The website and article publication date variables were renamed, and the article publication date variable was parsed into date format:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Return error and stop execution if a json is not returned

    if (http_type(resp) != &quot;application/json&quot;) {
    stop(&quot;API did not return json&quot;, call. = FALSE)
    }

    # Return error if there is a http error, else parse the content from the json file and store the title, text, date, and website in a tibble

    if (http_error(resp) == TRUE) {
        warning(&quot;The request failed&quot;)
    } else {
        news_tbl &lt;- fromJSON(content(resp, as = &quot;text&quot;, encoding = &quot;UTF-8&quot;), flatten = TRUE)  %&gt;%
        as_tibble()

        if (nrow(news_tbl) != 0) {
            news_tbl &lt;- news_tbl %&gt;% mutate(date = as.Date(discoverDate), website = website.domainName) %&gt;% select(title, text, date, website)
        }</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="cleaning-variables" class="section level5">
<h5>2.3 Cleaning variables</h5>
<p>The next step in the data wrangling process involved cleaning the selected variables. The transformed tibble was searched for NA values, of which the website variable was found to contain three. As the website variable was not needed for all analyses, these observations were kept in order to maintain sample size.</p>
<p>After parsing the JSON files, many unicode characters (e.g., “i019m”) were found in the text and title variable data and were transformed into ASCII characters using the ‘stringi’ package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>perf_news %&lt;&gt;% mutate(text = stringi::stri_trans_general(perf_news$text, &quot;latin-ascii&quot;), title = stringi::stri_trans_general(perf_news$title, &quot;latin-ascii&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Next, the tibble was searched for duplicate observations. Strings from the title column were transformed to lower case and then duplicate observations were then removed using the distinct function from ‘dplyr’:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>perf_news %&lt;&gt;% mutate(title = str_to_lower(title))
perf_news %&lt;&gt;% distinct(title, .keep_all = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the tibble was manually inspected for errors and subsequent observations were removed:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>perf_news &lt;- perf_news %&gt;%
  filter(!(perf_news$title == perf_news$title[52])) %&gt;% 
  filter(!(perf_news$title == perf_news$title[3]))</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="tidy-text" class="section level5">
<h5>2.4 Tidy text</h5>
<p>For the majority of analyses in this project, a tidy data structure was used. A tidy data structure is one where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table (Wickham, 2014). Accordingly, the cleaned tibbles above were tokenised into a ‘tidy text’ format, with one word per row as specified in Silge &amp; Robinson (2017):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_news &lt;- perf_news %&gt;% unnest_tokens(word, text)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, stop words (e.g., “the”, “to”, “of”, etc.) were removed:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_news &lt;- tidy_news %&gt;% anti_join(stop_words)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data-sets" class="section level3">
<h3>3. DATA SETS</h3>
<p>The wrangled data set, tidy_news, contained 18,160 observations, split across 74 news articles from a variety of sources. Each article contained the word ‘perfectionism’ or ‘perfect’ in the title and ‘perfectionism’ in the text on at least one occasion, as specified in the search parameters in section 3.1. The date range of the articles was from 2017-11-22 to 2018-07-03 (these limits were imposed by the API). A subset of the data can bee seen in the table below:</p>

<p>It should be noted that although the tidy_news data set formed the basic data structure on which an array of analyses were performed, the data set was further wrangled into several other forms. This included a tidy data set tokenised by sentence, and a document-term matrix (among others). In the interest of conciseness, examples of these data sets have been omitted from this report, however, code for these data set transformations can be found in the appendix.</p>

<h3>4. ANALYSES</h3>
<hr />
<div id="frequency-distributions" class="section level5">
<h5>4.1 Frequency distributions</h5>
<p>In order to understand the underlying structure of the data, several exploratory data analyses were performed.</p>
<p><em>Term frequency distribution</em>: the frequency of terms in each article were calculated and then divided by the total number of terms in each article (i.e., term frequency) as can be seen in Figure 1:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/projects/2018-08-05-perfectionism-in-the-public-domain-a-natural-language-processing-approach_files/figure-html/term%20frequency%20distribution-1.png" alt="Figure 1. Term frequency across all articles." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:term frequency distribution)Figure 1. Term frequency across all articles.
</p>
</div>
<p>The distribution in Figure 1 demonstrates a large positive skew, as would be expected in a corpus of natural language such as the one in this study. This is because some types of words such as articles (e.g., ‘the’) appear more frequently than other types of words.</p>
<p><em>Zipf’s law</em>: to further explore the term frequency distribution in Figure 1, frequency rank against term frequency (on logarithmic scales) was plotted. A linear model was fitted to the plot to further examine the underlying data structure (Figure 2):</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/projects/2018-08-05-perfectionism-in-the-public-domain-a-natural-language-processing-approach_files/figure-html/Zipfs%20law-1.png" alt="Figure 2. Zipfs law applied to the data." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:Zipfs law)Figure 2. Zipfs law applied to the data.
</p>
</div>
<p>The relationship between term frequency and rank in Figure 2 represents that of Zipf’s law (an interpretation of the power law). That is, that there is an inverse relationship between term frequency and rank (i.e., the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, etc.). The middle section of the rank range in Figure 2 has a gradient of -0.76, as determined by the fitted linear model, demonstrating that the data in this study does not strictly abide to Zipf’s law (i.e., a perfect case of Zipf’s law would result in a gradient of -1). Furthermore, there are small deviations at both the higher and lower ranked words. This means that the data set contains fewer rare and common words than would typically be predicted by a power law. Nonetheless, these kind of deviations are not uncommon for many kinds of natural language (Silge &amp; Robinson (2017). Collectively, the plots in Figure 1 and Figure 2 confirm that data in this project represent a typical corpus of natural language.</p>
</div>
<div id="word-frequencies" class="section level5">
<h5>4.2 Word frequencies</h5>
<p>To understand the basic text composition of the corpus of news articles, a list of custom stop words was removed from the data (see appendix) and the most common words were found (Figure 3):</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/projects/2018-08-05-perfectionism-in-the-public-domain-a-natural-language-processing-approach_files/figure-html/word%20frequencies%20bar-1.png" alt="Figure 3. The most common words across all articles." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:word frequencies bar)Figure 3. The most common words across all articles.
</p>
</div>
<p>The most common words match those one would expect to find in a corpus of language discussing perfectionism. For example, words such as ‘expectations’, ‘standards’, and ‘pressure’ appear, words commonly used in the academic domain that reflect the high expectations perfectionists place upon themselves. Other words such as ‘students’, ‘college’, and ‘university’ also appear, again, unsurprising given that a large body of academic research has been conducted in University samples. This basic frequency analysis indicates that the words used in this corpus of text can be paralleled to that in the academic domain. Figure 4 demonstrates a further exploration into the most common words used (with the size of the word equating to frequency):</p>

<div id="sentiment-analyses" class="section level5">
<h5>4.3 Sentiment Analyses</h5>
<p><em>Sentiment time analysis</em>: Having established that the data represented a typical corpus of natural language, and contained words inline with those one may expect in a corpus of text examining perfectionism, a sentiment analysis over time was performed. This was done in order to explore the underlying polarity of the data (i.e., is perfectionism reported in a positive or negative fashion), and to see if this has changed over time. To achieve this, articles were first tokenised by sentence and assigned a sentence number. Next, the sentences were tokenised by word. To compute a sentiment score for each article, individual word sentiment scores across each sentence were summed, and then each sentence sentiment score across each article was summed. Analyzing sentiment in sentence units, as was done here, better captures the structure of natural language over simpler unigram methods such as summing individual word sentiment scores across a whole text (Silge &amp; Robinson, 2017). In order to provide a multifaceted sentiment analysis, three sentiment lexicons (AFINN, Bing, and NRC) were used to determine the sentiment of each article. For each lexicon, sentiment was split into negative and positive classifications, inline with the theory on perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns, as can be seen in Figure 5:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/projects/2018-08-05-perfectionism-in-the-public-domain-a-natural-language-processing-approach_files/figure-html/sentiment%20analyses-1.png" alt="Figure 5. Sentiment analysis over time." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:sentiment analyses)Figure 5. Sentiment analysis over time.
</p>
</div>
<p>The data in Figure 5 reveals several noteworthy artifacts about the data. Firstly, the frequency of publications over time remains consistent, with no time period demonstrating a noticeable increase in publication frequency. Secondly, there appears to be no significant trends in sentiment over time (i.e., the distribution of sentiment scores remains consistent over the time). Finally, the plots reveal that articles report perfectionism in both a positive and negative manner. Using the AFINN and Bing sentiments, perfectionism is frequently reported in a negative fashion, whereas the NRC lexicon demonstrates the opposite effect. One reason for the observed difference in sentiment scores between lexicons may be the higher ratio of positive to negative words used in the NRC lexicon in comparison to the AFINN and Bing lexicons. The table below demonstrates this difference between the Bing and NRC lexicons:</p>

</table>
<p><em>Frequent positive and negative words</em>: the most frequent positive and negative words across all texts were found using the Bing sentiment lexicon as shown in Figure 6:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/projects/2018-08-05-perfectionism-in-the-public-domain-a-natural-language-processing-approach_files/figure-html/positive%20negative%20bar-1.png" alt="Figure 6. The most frequent positive and negative terms contributing to sentiment." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:positive negative bar)Figure 6. The most frequent positive and negative terms contributing to sentiment.
</p>
</div>
<p>Similar to the term frequency analysis conducted earlier, many predictable terms appear. For example, of the most frequent negative terms, ‘failure’, ‘mistakes’, and ‘unrealistic’ are commonly used in the academic literature to denote the unrealistic expectations perfectionists demand upon themselves, and their associated fear of failure and mistakes. This also extends to terms such as ‘hard’, ‘unhealthy’, and ‘depression’, terms in the academic literature which denote the experiences perfectionists typically find themselves in. On the contrary, of the most frequent positive terms, many terms appear unexpected. Indeed some terms such as ‘positive’ and ‘healthy’ do parallel those terms used in the academic literature (denoting perfectionistic strivings), however, terms such as ‘love’, ‘worth’, and ‘happy’ are not common occurrences in academic texts. Moreover, one would expect literature discussing perfectionism to discuss low self-worth, and a deficit of happiness and love reflecting the relationship and life difficulties associated with perfectionism (Dunkley et al., 2003; Hewitt and Flett, 2002). Perhaps one explanation for the occurrence of unexpected words is the use of unigrams to determine sentiment. Indeed, statements such as ‘not happy’ reflect a negative sentiment, yet result in a positive sentiment as the outcome (i.e, not gets discarded as a stop word and happy gets treated as a positive sentiment) using the methods employed above. One way to overcome and further explore this is through the use of bigrams.</p>
</div>
<div id="bigrams" class="section level5">
<h5>4.4 Bigrams</h5>
<p><em>Bigram sentiment time analysis</em>: in order to account for any negation words in the data set and their effect on sentiment scores, a further sentiment analysis using bigrams was performed. First, the perf_news data set was tokenised by bigrams while keeping track of sentence number. Then, a sentiment analysis was performed by reversing the sentiment score of any bigrams that matched a list of negation words (‘not’, ‘never’, ‘no’, ‘without’). As was done in the unigram sentiment analysis conducted previously, individual word sentiment scores across each sentence were summed, and then each sentence sentiment score across each article was summed to achieve a sentiment score for each article, as can be seen in Figure 7:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="/projects/2018-08-05-perfectionism-in-the-public-domain-a-natural-language-processing-approach_files/figure-html/bigram%20sentiment-1.png" alt="Figure 7. Sentiment analysis over time using bigrams." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:bigram sentiment)Figure 7. Sentiment analysis over time using bigrams.
</p>
</div>
<p>The data in Figure 7 demonstrate that after controlling for negation words, the articles still maintained a split across both positive and negative sentiments. However, in this instance, there was a heavier weighting towards a negative sentiment (as would be expected after controlling for negation words).</p>
<p><em>Bigram frequency</em>: having tokenised the data set by bigrams, a frequency count of the most common bigrams was computed to further explore the underlying structure of the data, as can be seen in the table below:</p>

</table>
<p>The data in the above table demonstrates that the public reporting of perfectionism is inline with the latest research in the academic domain. For instance, the most frequent bigram terms closely match those of a recent publication by Curran and Hill (2017) published in Psychological Bulletin in which ‘social media’, ‘socially prescribed (perfectionism)’ and ‘mental health’ are discussed in the context of ‘college students’.</p>
<p><em>Bigram igraph</em>: to visualise the relationship among bigrams simultaneously, the data was arranged into a network of connected nodes, as can be seen in Figure 8:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<div id="pairwise-correlations" class="section level5">
<h5>4.5 Pairwise correlations</h5>
<p><em>Pairwise correlations</em>: to determine which words various perfectionism terms (e.g., perfect, perfectionist, etc.) coalesce with, pairwise correlations were calculated using the phi coefficient. This identified how much more likely it was that a word would appear in conjunction with a perfectionism term, or that neither term appeared, than that one appeared without the other (Figure 9):</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p class="caption">
(#fig:pairwise cor)Figure 9. Pairwise correlations with various perfectionism terms.
</p>
</div>
<p>The words correlated with perfectionism terms mirrors those found in the frequency analysis conducted previously. These words include ‘mistakes’, ‘fear’, ‘failure’, and ‘expectations’, all words in the arsenal of the academic perfectionism lexicon. Moreover, the terms correlated with ‘perfect’ and ‘perfectionists’ are in keeping with this theme, albeit they are less frequently employed terms in the academic literature. For instance, the occurrence of the terms ‘pregnancy’, ‘person’, ‘kids’, and ‘week’ are not published about frequently in the academic domain, but indeed, a small handful of articles do exists examining these topics (e.g., Macedo et al., 2009).</p>
</div>
<div id="topic-models" class="section level5">
<h5>4.6 Topic models</h5>
<p><em>Model fit</em>: one question of interest is what topics perfectionism coalesces with in the collected news articles. In order to answer such a question the data must be divided into a set of natural groups. One such method for achieving this is topic modelling, a method of unsupervised classification of documents. In topic modelling, each documented is treated as a mixture of topics, and each topic as a mixture of words. This prevents documents being categorised into discrete groups, and allows for overlap in terms of content in a way that represents the structure of natural language. Consequently, topic models were fitted to the data. First, a document-term matrix was calculated and then the ‘ldatuning’ package was used to determine the optimum number of topics (<em>k</em>). The results from this optimisation process can be observed in Figure 10:</p>

<p>The results in Figure 10 indicate the optimum number of topics (<em>k</em>) occurs in the range 6-15, as indicated by the variance in extremum. Subsequently, topic models were fitted incrementally in this range and qualitatively evaluated at each stage. In this instance, the optimum number of topics occurred at <em>k</em> = 9.</p>
<p><em>Word-topic probabilities</em>: having established the number of topics (<em>k</em> = 9), the per-topic-per-word probabilities (“beta”) were then calculated. The beta probabilities demonstrate the most common words within topics, as demonstrated in Figure 11:</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>As can be seen in Figure 11, some topics overlap. For example, topics three, five, and seven contain at least one of the terms ‘life’ and ‘people’ in the top two terms, whereas topics four, seven, and nine contain the terms ‘kids’ or ‘parents’. It can be observed that there are meaningful differences between the nine topics, with some of these topics in keeping with the perfectionism themes highlighted so far. For example topic two is unique in its use of terms such as ‘college’ and ‘students’ and reflects the academic research of Curran and Hill (2017) highlighted previously. Other topics are also unique, such as topics four and seven, but their relevance to perfectionism is not as clear. For example, topic one contains key terms such as ‘code’, ‘music’, and ‘time’, topics not frequently employed in the academic literature. That is not to say that all discussions of perfectionism in the public domain should exactly mirror those in the academic domain, rather, it is interesting to note the diversity of topics discussed outside of the academic setting, as exemplified in this topic model.</p>

<h3>5. SUMMARY</h3>
<hr />
<p>Three key themes emerged in the data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The most frequently used words across all articles closely mirror those used in the academic literature. This is true across the unigram and bigram term frequencies. There is a general discussion around the themes of ‘pressure’ and ‘standards’ in ‘universities’ and ‘college’, all themes researched in great depth in the academic setting. This preliminary indicates that perfectionism is, at least in part, being discussed in the public domain in a manner that reflects the broader body of academic research.</p></li>
<li><p>The sentiment analyses revealed two important artifacts of the data. Firstly, perfectionism is discussed in both a positive and negative fashion. The dichotomy of positive and negative aspects of perfectionism closely mirrors the large body of research in the academic domain investigating perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns respectively. Secondly, in general, there is a heavier weighting towards the more negative aspects of perfectionism. Interestingly, this pattern of findings also mirrors that in the academic domain. While there is evidence to suggest that perfectionism is associated with some positive outcomes, processes and characteristics, there is a larger body of evidence indicating that perfectionism has a greater association with negative outcomes, processes, and characteristics (Hill, 2014). This effect held true even after controlling for negation words (e.g., not, never, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>The topic model analysis revealed a large diversity in topics across the articles. This implies that in some instances, perfectionism is being talked about in settings that typically fall outside of academic research. This may suggest that in some instances, perfectionism is being reported in the public domain in a manner not in keeping with the broader scientific evidence. However, this assertion requires careful scrutiny, as the topics require contextualising within each article to understand their significance, and the impact of any misreporting would require further analysis.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>6. RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
<hr />
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The NewsRiver API imposed limits on article retrieval dates so future research should endeavor to investigate perfectionism over a larger date range. One method to achieve this would be to build a web crawler in R that scrapes new texts from a list of provided URL’s.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to negation words, natural language often contains valence shifters (i.e., amplifiers (intensifiers), adversative conjunctions, etc.) which affect text polarity sentiment. Future research may use a package such as ‘sentimentr’ to overcome these additional valence shifters and increase the validity of the text sentiment.</p></li>
<li><p>The data in this study were limited to articles published in English. While the vast majority of academic literature is published in English, the translations of the findings of this study cannot be extended outside of English speaking, Western populations. This is because societal and cultural factors affect the implicit meaning behind psychological constructs, such as perfectionism (Hui &amp; Triandis, 1989). Therefore, it is recommended that future research investigates the sentiment and topics of perfectionism in other languages.</p></li>
