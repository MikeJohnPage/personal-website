## Personal Statement

A junior data scientist that is innovative, analytical, and revels on intellectual challenges. Has a scientific publication record and experience delivering a data workflow, from data collection, to implementing statistical and machine learning methods, to relevant and meaningful delivery of results. Excellent communicator who thrives in creating a story from data and works diligently in interdisciplinary teams to deliver timely results.

## Relevant Skills

*Technologies:* R, Python, MySQL, PostgresSQL, SPSS Statistics, Excel, Bash, G-Power, Git   
*Machine Learning:* topic modelling, sentiment analysis, clustering, linear and logistic regression  
*Statistics:* descriptive statistics, ANOVA, *t*-test, multilevel modelling  
*Skills:* data mining, web scraping, API clients, data wrangling, exploratory analysis  
*Data libraries:* NumPy, Pandas, tidyverse, httr, jsonlite, xml2, widyr, blogdown, topicmodels

## Completed Projects

[*Perfectionism in the Public Domain: A Natural Language Processing Approach:*](https://www.mikejohnpage.com/projects/perfectionism-in-the-public-domain-a-natural-language-processing-approach/) built an API client in R using the *httr* package that gathered news articles from newsriver.io. Using a tidy data approach, I then performed sentiment analysis and topic models using latent Dirichlet allocation.

[*Multilevel Modelling in SPSS:*](https://www.mikejohnpage.com/blog/multilevel-modelling-in-spss/) wrote a script in SPSS syntax that executed multilevel (hierarchical linear) models on nested physiological and psychological data.

[*GGDOT Hacknight:*](https://www.mikejohnpage.com/blog/ggdot-hacknight-using-box-cox-transformations-and-regression-to-analyse-the-co2-emissions-of-food/) I ran Box-Cox transformations and regression in R to analyse the CO2 emissions of food. I created new features in the data set and found a novel and unexpected relationship in the data. The finding is now being further validated by the GGDOT group before being shared with the Public health community.

## Current Projects

*Megatron:* an R package that iterates through a list of data transformations, measuring distribution fit at each stage using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests and returns a normal data set with transformation summaries.

*Selectr:* an R package engineered to automate the statistical test selection process. Scans data frame objects for scales of measurement and takes user parameters to return a recommended statistical test and associated R package.
